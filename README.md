The MODELSIM Directory contains the modelsim project and the MAT_CODE directory contains the matlab model of the Gaussian Noise Generator.

Copy the matlab output "awgn_new.txt" into MODELSIM Directory.

The co-efficient tables for log, square root, sine and cosine calculations were generated them ranmdomly. Hence the result is incorrect. As such I could not verify the results of the hardware noise generator.
